    Use this endpoint to implement any clean-up for a Skill when it is no longer used by a project.

    Skills which make use of the init endpoint may find the delete endpoint particularly useful for
    cleaning up any long-running tasks or stored data associated with the provided projectId.

    The delete endpoint will be called every time a DDNA Studio project using this Skill is deleted.
    It will also be called when a project using the Skill removes it, and is then redeployed.
